# LiveViewCounter

A small test LiveView project to learn how to dynamically create and destroy
arbitrary counter processes that broadcast realtime updates to many users.

Built on top of the work in the [Phoenix LiveView Counter Tutorial](https://github.com/dwyl/phoenix-liveview-counter-tutorial)

Inspired by an ElixirForum thread: [LiveView + PubSub topics with GenServer to keep state for each](https://elixirforum.com/t/liveview-pubsub-topics-with-genserver-to-keep-state-for-each/46680/3)
